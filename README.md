Assignment for our first React project, studying web development at YRGO.
We found a museum API (metsmuseeum) that supplied pictures of artworks from their collection of artists. From this we made a game where the task is to guess what artist from a list of 10 who created the painting that is currently showing, you get help along the way by recieving some hints comparing your guess in correlation to the right answer.
